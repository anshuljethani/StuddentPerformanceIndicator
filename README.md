## Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries to handle data processing, visualization, and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of each library:

Pandas: Provides high-performance data manipulation and analysis tools. It’s used for reading, processing, and analyzing data.

NumPy: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It’s used for numerical computations.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is used for making statistical graphics and visualizations easier and more attractive.

Matplotlib: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It’s used for plotting data.

Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including various machine learning algorithms and tools for model evaluation.

CatBoost: A gradient boosting library that handles categorical features automatically and is known for its high performance and accuracy.


Sys: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter. It’s typically used for system-specific parameters and functions.

OS: Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system. It’s often used for interacting with the file system and environment variables.
